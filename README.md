## Overview
This is a simple game where you will try to guess the secret number.
It is made through a course: 
- The Complete JavaScript course 2023: From Zero to Expert! Udemy by Jonas Schmidtmann

#### Live link https://guess-my-number-ee.netlify.app/

## Features
- Write a number between 1 and 20 in the text-box and click "check". The screen will tell you if the number is to high, too low or invalid. You will also get a lower score for each try.
- When you have guessed the right number, the score will be stored as highscore. It will only change if you beat the highscore again.
